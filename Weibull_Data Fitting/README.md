### Problem Statement 
Draw random samples of size 10, 30 and 100 from a generalized exponential distribution and fit these to 
- GE distribution 
- Weibull distribution 
- Lindley distribution 
Do a complete analysis of the estimates obtained in each case

### Generating random data
I generated random samples using Inverse Probability Transformation method.

### Fitting the Data
I read a couple of research papers to understand how to estimate the Maximum Likelihood Estimator of Weibull distribution and then implemented it using Matlab. Using the random samples I generated in first step, I used MLE method to fit data to Weibull distribution.

### Goodness of Fit
Implementing Chi-Squared test and Mean Square Error tests to determine the goodness of fit.
